To have text layered over your field of vision is a more intimate experience than looking at that same text on a device in or near your hand.  

Things that are acceptable on a smartphone or other wearable device are not always great experiences on Glass or other wearable HUDs. 

Good design on a smartglass is invisible, while good design on a smartphone wows.  Bad design on Glass is often intolerable (as in, the user will not tolerate, or continue to use, the device), while bad design on smartphones is well-tolerated by a majority of users.
