- I have experience designing for web, mobile, and wearable heads-up displays (HUDs). I would love the opportunity to design experiences on other wearables as well. <p> However, I design for the user, not the device. Different devices require very different approaches, but the goal should be a coherent, consistent multidevice experience.</p>
