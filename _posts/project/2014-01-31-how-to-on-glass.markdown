####Google Glassware
A popular how-to site commissioned this design for their first official Glassware.

Even though we were designing for a tech-savvy early-adopting demographic, there wasn’t a lot of room for customization dialogues or any kind of interaction that would force the user to do anything more than briefly glance at each card. Users tend to be much less tolerant of excessive interactions on Glass and will stop using Glassware if it takes too much of their attention away from what is in front of them.

 Personas:  Ellen, 38.  Glassware developer, very experienced with using Google Glass and other new technology.  She is tolerant of the occasional glitch, but not of repeated unnecessary interactions.
 
Juan, 24.  Slightly later adopter than Ellen.  Is finishing college and looking for his first job as a community manager.  He is a beginning hardware hacker and got Google Glass for his DIY community non-profit.  He is still adjusting to the technology and is used to smooth consumer-ready interactions.

Unique considerations for Glass:  Google provides basic design principles for Glass.  However, there were other parts of the puzzle that were more specific to this design or not covered in the basic principles.  Part of the process also involved working with Google’s Glassware review team to get a custom invocation command.  Other Glass-specific questions included:  How much should the design take into account other devices?  What are the best ways to take advantage of gestural feedback?  Of the cutting-edge functionalities that Glass offers, what is reliable and smooth enough to provide a good experience?  How can we best present and prioritize user-generated content with such limited screen space?

I was able to test some aspects of the design through an HTML prototype.  At the time of this project, there was no satisfactory prototyping service for Glassware that could be run on Google Glass. I conducted informal interviews with Glass Explorers and others in the target demographic using a locally-hosted HTML prototype.  It loaded through the Google Glass browser and so didn’t have the full interactive functionality of the final product.  However, it enabled me to gain insights as to how users best processed information in a single glance and what layout and feedback options made the process the most efficient.
One of the most frequently repeated items of user feedback involved the card layout.  For my initial design, I had based the card layout on Google’s suggested layout template for an image and text as it was the only one to comfortably allow for both an image and 2-3 sentences of text.  However, I repeatedly heard, “The picture is so small,” and “it doesn’t allow me to see any details.”  The client and I decided to try another layout template with a horizontal, full-card image.  This was preferred by users looking at the prototype.

However, this introduced a new challenge.  Because the horizontal image took up the entire card and some of the user-generated steps were at least 2-3 sentences long, we would have to find a more creative way to present the text along with the image.

One solution we decided against used the data from Glass’s internal measurement unit (IMU) to allow a user to scroll through text based on their head position. This didn’t make it into the final design due to concerns about the smoothness of the experience within the limitations of the existing technology.
