####CYRENE
Cyrene is avnot-for-profit consignment platform founded by an interior designer who wanted an exceptionally beautiful site.

Her organization enabled users to donate fine art, antiques, and jewelry to benefit a charity of their choice.  They also had the option to sell an item and donate only a percentage of the proceeds.  These items were available for purchase on the site, but she strongly believed that shopping should not be the focus of the site.

Simplicity was key.  We decided on an elegant one-page layout.
