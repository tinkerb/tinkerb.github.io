####HUD HOWTO
My role:  UX Design, Visual Design, Branding
At the Augmented World Expo Hackathon from May 26-27, my team and I designed and began developing HUD HowTo, an augmented reality application to help users receive instructions through their smartglasses.

I conceptualized and designed the ant logo to convey the idea of diligent work broken up into small parts.

Tutorial videos are divided into five-second segments, then paused to allow the user to either move forward or rewatch a video segment.  (Five seconds was what seemed best to our team when mimicking interactions, but for a more polished product I would prefer to do more user research to determine the best timing.)

If a user repeats a segment multiple times, the user is then given the option to call for help.  In the case of a product’s instruction manual, this would be customer support.  The customer service representative would have access to video from the user’s smartglasses in order to better help them.
