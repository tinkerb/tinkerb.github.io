####CYRENE
Cyrene is a Christian not-for-profit consignment platform founded by an interior designer who wanted an exceptionally beautiful site.

Her organization enabled users to donate fine art, antiques, and jewelry to benefit a charity of their choice.  The site was modified for mobile to showcase the pieces as if they were in a museum or jewelers' display case.  

The project was discontinued due to unexpected events in the client's personal life.
