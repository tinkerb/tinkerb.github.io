####DELIVERLY

Concept: Users can order pizzas delivered based on specific ingredients.

Personas:  James, 38.  He is a teacher.  His wife is a soldier currently overseas. They have two kids (4,7) with nut, egg, and gluten intolerance, one of whom is very picky.  He uses the app to order pizzas delivered or ready-to-pick-up after work.   
Nimmie, 28, is a single social media manager.  She identifies as a foodie but doesn't like to cook.  She uses the app to try new recipes.

Research: I asked a group of potential users to play with different paper components to construct paper prototypes.  From this session, two distinct designs emerged, which I then A/B tested by creating clickable, high-fidelity prototypes of two designs, then posting QR codes linking to the prototypes in the windows of pizza restaurants and in the frozen foods sections of grocery stores. Users were then directed to one of the two designs on their mobile devices. The successful design is the one with longer pageview times and higher rates of successful task completion (in this case, selecting a pizza to order).
