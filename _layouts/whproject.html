           <p>I was contracted to redesign a the guided editor and article creation page of a popular how-to site.

I created a large paper-and-glass prototype to add a physical element to the user interactions and to allow the different pieces of the article creation process to be quickly separated and rearranged. This enabled the determination of a system of visual hierarchy that prioritized the most important parts of the article in a way that made sense to the user.</p>

The final design uses an accordion-style layout to visually conceal unnecessary optional parts. Users can then add those parts to the article, but they were kept out of the way when they were not needed.

One challenge was deciding where to allow a user to opt to create more than one “method,” or way of carrying out the task. The client wanted to encourage the creation of more methods, but introducing this option too early in the process or in a forced interaction (e. g. “Does this article have more than one method? Yes or no”) had the potential to discourage new article creators. The solution was a WYSIWYG article creation format with very obvious text entry fields for the method numbers. This let users know what their options were without forcing them to provide any kind of feedback if they weren’t going to create a new method. It blended in with the interaction as a whole while remaining visible enough not to be missed.</p>
